# Xrm.Tools.CRMDiscoAPI

This is an example API wrapper for calling the new Dynamics 365 Global Discovery service.

The Dynamics 365 Discovery service is intended to be used to learn what Dynamics 365 organizations a user has access to and to get the API urls that would be used to access each of them.

Applications should use the Discovery Service to avoid hard coding and to allow working with multiple subscriptions
